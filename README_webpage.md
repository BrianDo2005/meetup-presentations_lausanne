# How to update webpage

Maintaining the webpage requires three folders:
- `webpage-drafts` in this repro
- `webpage` in this repro
- `rladieslausanne.github.io` on the rladieslausanne github repro (only exists for this specific reason)

## workflow
1. Create some markdown document in `webpage-drafts`. Keep working on it until it looks good. 
2. Copy the file to `webpage/content/`
3. Run `run_webpage.R` (after running a preview in R-studio)
4. commit changes made to `webpage`
5. add all files to `rladieslausanne.github.io`, commit and push changes. 
6. Done!
