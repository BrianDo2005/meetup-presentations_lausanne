## Meetup #4 on June 7 @ ImpactHub

We will have our fourth meetup on June 7, 2018, 7 pm at [ImpactHub](https://lausanne.impacthub.net/) (door opens at 6:30 pm).

During one hour we will have four speakers talking about four topics, each presentation will be 10-20 min long (aka ThundeR talks!).

We also encourage you to bring along your R problems 30 min before the meetup starts - we :purple_heart:solving R riddles!
