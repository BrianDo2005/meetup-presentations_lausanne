Blogdown + some css hacks.  

Sourcecode [here](sinarueeger/webpage-rladies)

Heavily based on [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/posts/contribute-a-post/)

Why? Allowing people that cannot attend our meetups to be part of it too.

## Contribute to our webpage

The goal of this webpage is, to keep people informed about our meetups under [news & blogposts](/categories/posts/), by posting  [**news**](/categories/news/), summaries from past [**meetups**](/categories/meetup/), [**interviews**](/categories/interview/) of our [speakers](/community/#speakers) and list [**blogposts**](/categories/blogpost/).
