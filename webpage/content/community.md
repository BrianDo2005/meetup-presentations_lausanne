## Come to our meetups

Participate in our meetups, talk to other R users over a drink and don't hesitate to bring R problems along!

## Be a speaker
As we always need R speakers for meetups, please get in touch with us! 

The only requirement is some passion for R. 

Watch out for *Lightening* or *ThundeR* talks! A great opportunity for everyone to present.

Here is what you will gain from it:

- Experience
- Exposure
- Being interviewed (if you like)

## Suggest speakers
If you know somebody that could present at our meetup, let us know!
